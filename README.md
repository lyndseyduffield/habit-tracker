# HabitTracker

![](https://github.com/lyndseyduffield/habit-tracker/workflows/Habit%20Tracker%20CI/badge.svg)

HabitTracker is a React/Redux application that runs in the browser using local storage as its database -- so each user's data is their own (private). Users can:  

* Add meaningful habits that they hope to implement in their lives.
* Edit a habit if they want to change something about it -- the time range, goal, etc.
* Keep track of their progress and hold themselves accountable using the streak feature. Streaks are a visual reminder and cannot be edited after the current day of a user's habit. 
* View their habits in a compact and extended view. 
* Add an accountability partner that will notified via email after 3 days of missing a habit (feature in progress).


## Technologies
